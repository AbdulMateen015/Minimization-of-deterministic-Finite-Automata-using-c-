# Minimization-of-deterministic-Finite-Automata-using-c-
Welcome to my DFA Minimization project in C++. This repository showcases my skills in algorithm design and C++ programming. Using Hopcroft's algorithm, it efficiently minimizes DFAs for applications in compilers, networking, and pattern matching. The project includes documentation, examples, and tests.
